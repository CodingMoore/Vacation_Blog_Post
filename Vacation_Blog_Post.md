 <h1>Vacation to Japan!!!</h1>

>Today I visited the famous Nara Shrine - with the worlds largest wooden Budda.  Holding up the enormouse building that houses the Budda, are a set of wooden pillars.  One pillar in particular has a hole cut into it.  The hole is the same size as the Budda's nostril, and if you are able to crawl through it, it is said that you will surely return to the shrine.

>The surrounding town is famous for it's deer population.  The animals wander through the streets begging for food.  While you are not officially supposed to feed them, you can find locals selling deer crackers on __every__ street corner.

>The food, as usual, was outstanding.  You couldn't throw a rock without hitting a store selling a local delicacy.

My favorites were...

- Curry Rice
- Ramen
- Beer
